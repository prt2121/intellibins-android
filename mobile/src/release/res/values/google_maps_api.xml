    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=80:AB:B4:A3:3C:C9:24:6B:73:DA:D7:3C:57:67:3B:35:04:EC:12:73%3Bcom.intellibins.recycle.activity

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    80:AB:B4:A3:3C:C9:24:6B:73:DA:D7:3C:57:67:3B:35:04:EC:12:73;com.intellibins.recycle.activity

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
